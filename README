WritingAssignment

WritingAssignment uses a list of objects from a YAML file to generate a writing assignment consisting of a group of random objects, a location, and a plot device. While the student writes the assignment, WritingAssignment keeps track of how many words, and does not consider the assignment completed until the minimum word requirement is met.
